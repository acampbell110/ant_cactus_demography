abstract = {Cheating is a focal concept in the study of mutualism, with the majority of researchers considering cheating to be both prevalent and highly damaging. However, current definitions of cheating do not reliably capture the evolutionary threat that has been a central motivation for the study of cheating. We describe the development of the cheating concept and distill a relative-fitness-based definition of cheating that encapsulates the evolutionary threat posed by cheating, i.e. that cheaters will spread and erode the benefits of mutualism. We then describe experiments required to conclude that cheating is occurring and to quantify fitness conflict more generally. Next, we discuss how our definition and methods can generate comparability and integration of theory and experiments, which are currently divided by their respective prioritisations of fitness consequences and traits. To evaluate the current empirical evidence for cheating, we review the literature on several of the best-studied mutualisms. We find that although there are numerous observations of low-quality partners, there is currently very little support from fitness data that any of these meet our criteria to be considered cheaters. Finally, we highlight future directions for research on conflict in mutualisms, including novel research avenues opened by a relative-fitness-based definition of cheating.},

@article{Bronstein2001,
abstract = {Mutualisms arc of central importance in biological systems. Despite growing attention in recent years, however, few conceptual themes have yet to be identified that span mutualisms differing in natural history. Here I examine the idea that the ecology and evolution of mutualisms are shaped by diverse costs, not only by the benefits they confer. This concept helps link mutualism to antagonisms such as herbivory, pr{\'{e}}dation, and parasitism, interactions defined largely by the existence of costs. I first briefly review the range of costs associated with mutualisms, then describe how one cost, the consumption of seeds by pollinator offspring, was quantified for one fig/pollinator mutualism. I compare this cost to published values for other fig/pollinator mutualisms and for other kinds of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms, notably the yucca/yucca moth interaction. I then discuss four issues that fundamentally complicate comparative studies of the cost of mutualism:. problems of knowing how to measure the magnitude of any one cost accurately; problems associated with using average estimates in the absence of data on sources of variation; complications arising from the complex correlates of costs, such as functional linkages between costs and benefits; and problems that arise from considering the cost of mutualism as a unilateral issue in what is fundamentally a reciprocal interaction. The rich diversity of as-yet unaddressed questions surrounding the costs of mutualism may best be investigated via detailed studies of individual interactions.},

@article{Bascompte2019,
abstract = {Mutualism is a type of interaction in which both partners benefit from each other. For example, a butterfly receives nectar, a rich source of food, from the flower of a plant and in turn moves pollen from that plant to another far away (Figure 1). In order to reflect about the widespread nature of mutualism, John N. Thompson proposed the following thought experiment: try to imagine a plant species that is viable in its natural habitat without using on top of its own nuclear genome the genomes of a mitochondrion, a chloroplast, of several mycorrhizal fungi, of several insects to pollinate it and of several species of bird to disperse its seeds. Mutualism is everywhere and it is assumed that mutualistic interactions have played a major role in the diversification of life on Earth. An often-cited example is the rich adaptive radiation of the flowering plants (angiosperms), with about 300,000 described species. Flowering plants originated around 160 million years ago and diversified fast during the Early Cretaceous, so that by around 120 million years ago they had become widespread. It is generally assumed that such a fast diversification is largely the result of the mutualistic interaction with pollinators. Thus, mutualism has been most likely shaping the diversity of species on Earth from an early stage. But the relationships between mutualism and diversity are not yet clear, mainly because mutualism has traditionally been studied within pairs or small groups of species. Also, mutualism has historically been studied in isolation from competition, so it is unclear how these two forces balance each other in ecological communities. Jordi Bascompte introduces mutualistic networks and how they affect biodiversity patterns.},

@article{Chamberlain2014,
abstract = {The net effects of interspecific species interactions on individuals and populations vary in both sign (-, 0, +) and magnitude (strong to weak). Interaction outcomes are context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species interactions, and while mutualism was most likely to change sign across contexts (and predation least likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of context dependency across these context types was not consistent among mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest variation in outcomes. We urge that studying context dependency per se, rather than focusing only on mean outcomes, can provide a general method for describing patterns of variation in nature. {\textcopyright} 2014.},
